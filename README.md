## Description
Goal: This project is a start to make an application with which we can map or highlight safe and or unsafe areas in an area. 

Present: An API with which live data changes a threeJS model to represent safe or unsafe places and the speed with which the user moves at that time. 
Features: Upon updating the data, the threejs model changes speed and color according to the latest data.

## Getting Started
The back-end is a node.js application made with express.

The front-end is made with ThreeJS.
